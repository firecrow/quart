x get initial single leval, functions working

x get cell design into function call stacks
    block -> cells ---------------
      |_____/-block -> cells----

x nested arithmetic
x clean up build to match exec
    x remove close cells from list
    x remove value fetching
- lexical scoped variable lookup 
    x variables inluded in broader statements (math for now)
    - lookup properly across blocks
- functions
    - function arguments seperator handling
    - functons as symbol values 
- logic operators 
    - if
        {x == nil}?{}:{}
    - while 
        {x < 10}...{}
